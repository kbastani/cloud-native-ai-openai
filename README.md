# Cloud-native AI Reference Architecture

Welcome to the official repository for our Cloud-native AI Reference Architecture. This project is dedicated to advancing the fundamental patterns of cloud-native AI development. Our focus is on empowering developers with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively integrate Python functions-as-a-service, enhancing continuous delivery, reliability, resiliency, safety, and scalability in applications leveraging OpenAI services (and others, but this repository is focused on OpenAI APIs).

## Project Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, there's a growing need for architectures that not only leverage the power of AI but do so in a way that's scalable, reliable, and secure. This repository aims to address this need by demonstrating how to side-car Python functions-as-a-serviceâ€”a technique that can significantly improve the development and deployment of cloud-native AI applications. Specifically, we'll explore patterns that enhance continuous delivery, reliability, resiliency, safety, and scalability when working with OpenAI services.

## Goals

The primary goals of this reference architecture include:

- **Improving Continuous Delivery**: Streamline the process of integrating new AI features and updates, ensuring rapid deployment and minimal downtime.
- **Enhancing Reliability**: Ensure that AI services are consistently available and perform as expected under various conditions.
- **Boosting Resiliency**: Build systems capable of recovering quickly from failures, maintaining operational integrity in the face of challenges.
- **Ensuring Safety**: Prioritize the security and privacy of data, protecting AI systems from vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Scaling with Ease**: Facilitate the growth of AI applications, allowing them to handle increased load without compromising performance.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and toolkit for developers looking to implement cloud-native AI patterns in their projects. It includes:

- **Code Examples**: Practical, reusable code snippets demonstrating how to side-car Python functions-as-a-service.
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines and recommendations for developing robust, scalable cloud-native AI applications.
